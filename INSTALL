INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS IN UNIX or MACOSX MACHINES

For the compilation, you need the Objective Caml compiler installed
in your computer. The compilation works for several versions of ocaml.

They freely distributed at address:
     http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
     http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/camlp5/

1. Have a clean switch with OCaml > 4.02

```
eval $(opam env)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
opam install --deps-only .
```

3. Build:

```
make
```

4- Do:

```
make distrib
```

   This creates a directory "distribution" where all executables programs
   and documentation are copied.

   This can constitute a "distribution" directory if you want to distribute
   executables.

5- To use GeneWeb, move the directory "distribution" to another place, or
   rename it.

   Go to this directory and launch the command "./gwsetup".

   The reason why it is better to move this directory is that "make clean"
   deletes it, and another "make distrib" overwrites it. If you created
   genealogic databases inside, they would be deleted.

- The Cygnus GNU-Win32 development tool, free (search in the Web)
